Code creates a normalised database that services the imagined needs of a time travel agency. This agency is based on certain assumptions of the functions
of time travel (such as that time travel 'gates' operate in a fixed geographic location).

Demonstrated in this project is the ability to create stored procedures, implement business rules, and design a relational database to be populated and used.
